# BTreeSet

`BTreeSet` in Rust is a data structure that implements a set backed by a BTree. Its functionality is similar to that of other set data structures in that it maintains a collection of unique elements and allows for operations like insertion, removal, and querying. But the elements in a `BTreeSet` are sorted according to an ordering relation, which may be customized by the user. The sorting enables efficient range queries as well as other operations such as finding the minimum or maximum element.
